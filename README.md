# Sparse Keypoint Segmentation of Lung Fissures: Efficient Geometric Deep Learning for Abstracting Volumetric Images
This repository contains the code for segmenting pulmonary fissures in CT images using keypoint extraction and geometric deep learning.

# Usage
## Install environment
Install the required packages using Anaconda and the provided environment file:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate fissure-segmentation
```

# Data
Datasets used in the evaluation are openly available for research purposes. Please refer to the original sources 
detailed below.

## Training / cross-validation data
The TotalSegmentator data set is the main data set used for this work. 
Download it from here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6802614 (v1.0).
The data has to be preprocessed with `preprocess_totalsegmentator_dataset.py`, make sure to point to the correct data
path `TS_RAW_DATA_PATH` in `constants.py`. The script selects applicable images (showing the entire thorax), extracts fissure 
segmentations from the lobe masks and crops the images to the thoracic region. Results will be written to 
`IMG_DIR_TS_PREPROC`.

## COPD validation data set
The COPD data set can be accessed here: https://med.emory.edu/departments/radiation-oncology/research-laboratories/deformable-image-registration/downloads-and-reference-data/copdgene.html
(citation: Castillo et al., Phys Med Biol 2013 https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155/58/9/2861)
The manual fissure annotations are available from here: http://www.mpheinrich.de/research.html#COPD (citation: 
RÃ¼haak et al., IEEE TMI 2017 https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2017.2691259).

## Pre-computing keypoints and features
The image data needs to be preprocessed by extracting keypoints and point features. Images need to be in one folder
with names of the form `<patid>_img_<fixed/moving>.nii.gz` with the corresponding fissure annotations 
`<patid>_fissures_<fixed/moving>.nii.gz` and lung mask `<patid>_mask_<fixed/moving>.nii.gz`. Masks can be generated
automatically by, e.g., using the `lungmask` tool https://github.com/JoHof/lungmask. Please set the image directory path
`IMG_DIR` in `constants.py`.
