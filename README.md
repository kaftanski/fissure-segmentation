# Sparse Keypoint Segmentation of Lung Fissures: Efficient Geometric Deep Learning for Abstracting Volumetric Images
This repository contains the code for segmenting pulmonary fissures in CT images using keypoint extraction and geometric deep learning.

![Overview of the pipeline](overview.png)

# Environment
Install the required packages using Anaconda and the provided environment file:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate fissure-segmentation
```

# Data
Datasets used in the evaluation are openly available for research purposes. Please refer to the original sources 
detailed below.

## Training / cross-validation data
The TotalSegmentator data set is the main data set used for this work. 
Download it from here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6802614 (v1.0).
The data has to be preprocessed with `preprocess_totalsegmentator_dataset.py`, make sure to point to the correct data
path `TS_RAW_DATA_PATH` in `constants.py`. The script selects applicable images (showing the entire thorax), extracts fissure 
segmentations from the lobe masks and crops the images to the thoracic region. Results will be written to 
`IMG_DIR_TS_PREPROC`.

## COPD validation data set
The COPD data set can be accessed here: https://med.emory.edu/departments/radiation-oncology/research-laboratories/deformable-image-registration/downloads-and-reference-data/copdgene.html
(citation: Castillo et al., Phys Med Biol 2013 https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155/58/9/2861)
The manual fissure annotations are available from here: http://www.mpheinrich.de/research.html#COPD (citation: 
RÃ¼haak et al., IEEE TMI 2017 https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2017.2691259).

The images should be named `<patid>_img_<fixed/moving>.nii.gz` and be in the same folder (`data/images/COPD`) as the
fissure annotations `<patid>_fissures_<fixed/moving>.nii.gz` and lung masks `<patid>_mask_<fixed/moving>.nii.gz`.
Masks can be generated automatically by, e.g., using the `lungmask` tool https://github.com/JoHof/lungmask.

Then, preprocessing can be applied by running `preprocess_copd_dataset.py`.

## Pre-computing keypoints and features
Keypoints and features are pre-computed from the image data. Run the following scripts:
1. `python -m data_processing.keypint_extraction`
2. `python -m data_processing.point_features`
Results will be written into `data/points` by default.

# Train models
The different models can be trained using the following scripts:
- Point Cloud segmentation networks (DGCNN, PointNet, PointTransformer): `train_point_segmentation.py`
- Point Cloud Autoencoder (PC-AE): `train_pc_ae.py`
- Keypoint CNN (MobileNetV3 + LR-ASPP): `train_keypoint_cnn.py` (pre-trained weights are available in `results/lraspp_recall_loss`)
Run the scripts with the `-h` flag to see available options.

# Evaluate models
The given training scripts already contain test functions for all models.

Evaluation of the PC-AE reconstruction of fissures can be done using the `evaluate_pc_ae.py` script. This will take a
trained point cloud segmentation network and apply a trained PC-AE for mesh reconstruction (instead of Poisson surface
reconstruction). 

The nnU-Net baseline was evaluated using `evaluate_nnunet.py`.
